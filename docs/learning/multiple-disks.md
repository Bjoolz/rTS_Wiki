# How to use multiple disks in Windows
Always install your applications onto your primary drive. You can not install applications onto your second drive because you think it means you won't have to reinstall them next time you clean install windows. Everything will have to be installed again, but you can install the application data and games onto the secondary drive.

When you install applications, the data and files get stored in multiple locations and the registry (which you should never mess around with). Because of this, this is why every application has to be re-installed when you get a new operating system installed.

It is recommended to install all your programs onto your "C:\" Drive (Your primary drive) and then, where appropriate, change the install path for games and roaming data onto your secondary drives.

Storing Data on my other drive(s)
Once you install your software on your primary drive, you often can point the data path to other drives. You can do this with your downloads from your internet browser, videos and pictures and any games you download, for example.

You can change your default location for your download folder by right-clicking the download folder, selecting properties > Location >, then type in or "find target" of your other drive where you want it to reside.

You can casually store any other data, like documents, pictures, and videos, on the external drive without any issues, create a new folder and keep them as you usually would.

For things like Games, often, you can change the install path to be on your external drive. When you install games using a platform like Steam, Battle.net, EA/Origin, or Epic Games, you can often tell them where to install the games or even create a new game library so games will install there by default.

See links below on how to change game installs/library paths.
You can also copy and paste the data to your other drive if you have it installed, and when the install checks the data, it will see everything is there, and you won't have to re-download everything.

Origin - Copy your game install folder to your other drive, then reinstall, pointing to the new location
Epic Games - Copy your game install folder to your other drive, then reinstall, pointing to the new location

If you are unsure of what you are doing, make sure you take a backup of your data.
